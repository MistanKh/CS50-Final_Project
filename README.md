# CS50-Final Project - My Public Ip
### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/02nUZ_Kxx84

### Description: This is a simple Google Chorme extension that gets your public IP address really fast. You don't have to search for it on google, you can just click on this extension and it will display your public IP address.As we know that we have two IP addresses in our simple home network. One is your device IP address also known as private IP address. Second is your router's IP address. When you connect to a network and access the internet, requests are sent from your device's IP (Private IP address) and those requests are forwarded to the router's IP address (Public IP address). The requests are now on their way to the destination, example a server, and after processing the requests, the server sends its responses with your public IP and Private IP as the destination.Once the response reaches you router's IP (Public IP) it then forwards the responses to your device's IP (Private IP).So, in order to find your public IP you have to Google "what is my ip" and it show you your public IP. With this extension you can achieve that with just one click and in less than a second.
